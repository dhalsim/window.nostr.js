# window.nostr.js

a small `<script>` you can drop in any page that already uses [NIP-07](https://nips.nostr.com/7) and make it also work with [NIP-46](https://nips.nostr.com/46) automatically when the user doesn't have an extension installed.

## How to use it

Include `<script src="https://unpkg.com/window.nostr.js/dist/window.nostr.js"></script>` in your HTML and proceed to use [`window.nostr`](https://nips.nostr.com/7) normally.
